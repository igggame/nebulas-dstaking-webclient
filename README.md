## Pledge notice
1. The assets that the user participates in the pledge still exist in their own wallet.
2. At the beginning of each cycle (about 25 hours), NAX will be dynamically issued to the pledge address according to the pledge rate of the whole network in the previous cycle.
3. The more NASs that are pledged in the wallet, the longer the continuous pledge cycle (coin age), the more NAX is obtained.
4. If the pledge is reduced or the pledge is cancelled, the age of the coin will return to the initial state, and the additional pledge will calculate the average coin age.
5. When the wallet balance is less than the actual pledge, the pledge status is automatically released.
